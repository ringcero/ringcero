# Privacy Specification

**Version 1.0 // Last Revised: 28 Aug 2025**

---

## 1.0 Data Collection

We collect information you voluntarily provide. The only personally identifiable information we actively collect is your `email address` when you subscribe to our report notifications. Our forms are protected by `Cloudflare Turnstile`, which may process technical data for spam mitigation as per their own policies.

## 2.0 Data Utilization

Your email address is used exclusively for operational purposes: to deliver notifications when new reports are released, and to respond directly to inquiries you send to our contact address. Your data will not be sold, leased, or distributed.

## 3.0 Security & Third-Party Protocols

We employ secure, reputable third-party services for form submissions. While we prioritize data integrity, no method of digital transmission is infallible. We accept no liability for third-party data breaches.

## 4.0 User Autonomy & Opt-Out

You retain full control over your data. Every notification email we dispatch contains a functional `unsubscribe` link. Activating this link will permanently purge your email address from our active mailing list.

## 5.0 Inquiries

For questions or clarifications regarding this specification, contact our primary channel: [contact@ringcero.com](mailto:contact@ringcero.com).
